                    <p>The interface of the SARIT application consists of four main pages:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a start page for listing the works contained in SARIT and performing

                        </li>
                        <li>a page for displaying the SARIT project's description of the editorial
                            processes behind a SARIT text edition and for listing the text's table of
                            contents, reached after clicking the title of the text in the list of
                            works
                        </li>

                        <li>a page for viewing part of a text selected by clicking on a reference in the
                            table of contents or on a hit in the hitlist.

                    <div>
                        <p>The start page of the SARIT web platform displays a list of the texts in
                            the SARIT corpus and the search interface. </p>
                        <img width="100%" src="resources/img/search-interface.png"/>
                        <p>The list of texts gives the text's title,
                        notes its putative author(s) or
                        commentator(s), and whether the text uses
                        Devanagari script or romanisation.</p>
                        <p>There are also links for downloading the
                        texts in various formats, currently as epub or
                        raw XML.</p>

                        <p>The search interface, located on the right
                        of the list of works, allows you to search
                        through the texts in various ways.  The
                        options are described in <a
                        href="search-help-brief.html#search-help-interface">the
                        brief search help</a>.  If you tick one of the
                        boxes to the left of the title in the list of
                        works, the search will apply only to the
                        selected text or texts, regardless of the
                        author selection.</p>

                    <h2>The TEI Header and Table of Contents</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>Clicking a title in the list of works will display the TEI header of the
                            text and its table of contents, for example:</p>
                        <img width="75%" src="resources/img/header.png"/>
                        <p>The TEI header describes the text and the editorial processes that have
                            resulted in the SARIT edition. Since the header can be quite long, by
                            default only the first part, which gives the title and author(s) and
                            lists the persons and institutions that have contributed to the SARIT
                            version is shown. If you wish to access the whole TEI header, click the
                            Toggle Full Header button.</p>
                        <p>At the bottom of the page you will find the
                        table of contents of the SARIT text. You can
                        expand the contents by clicking on the
                        <code>+</code>, or go to a section by clicking
                        the link.</p>
                        <p>The table of contents can be expanded by clicking on the plus signs and
                            collapsed again by clicking on minus signs. The table of contents
                            descends three levels, i.e. divisions below the third level are not
                            shown (for reasons of speed).</p>
                        <p>Clicking on one of the links in the table of contents will take you to
                            the page view for the part of the text in question.</p>

                    <h2>The search results</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>After performing a search for, e.g.,
                        <code>*lakṣaṇ* AND *pratyakṣ*</code> limited
                        to the Tattvasaṅgraha, you will be presented
                        with a list of hits somewhat like this:</p>
                        <img src="resources/img/hitlist.png"/>
                        <p>The results of your search are presented in the form of a
                            keywords-in-context (KWIC) display, centring the strings that were found
                            matching your search term, with the context the matches occur in on
                            the left and right. Clicking the highlighted string in the center will
                            display the passage of text in which the hit occurs, with all matches
                            highlighted.</p>
                            <p>The hits are ordered according to their score. The score is a
                            measure of the relevancy of the hits in relation to the search. What
                            this means is a little technical, but, generally speaking, the more
                            often more of your search terms occur in a hit and the rarer the search
                            terms are within the texts searched, the higher the score will be.</p>
                        <p>The matches are grouped according to
                        meaningful divisions of the texts (e.g.,
                        sections).  The head of a group links to the
                        text as a whole (showing the header
                        information and table of contents) and the
                        part of the text in which the hit occurred
                        (displaying the text itself).  One such group (such
                        as the first one here) may contain several
                        high-ranking matches.</p>
                        <p>The hits are shown twenty at a time on each page. At the top, you have
                            the total number of hits and a means of navigating from hit group to hit
                            group.</p>

                    <h2>The Page View</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>After clicking on one of the links that leads to a direct display of a
                            page, you are shown the page view.</p>
                        <img src="resources/img/page-view.png"/>
                        <p>If you have clicked on a search term link in the hitlist, the search term(s)
                            will all be highlighted.</p>
                        <p>It is not possible to view a whole text, due to the heavy load on the
                            browser this would entail in case of very long texts, but as a substitute for this you can
                            download the whole text in a number of formats from the list of
                            works.</p>
                        <p>You have the option of moving back and forth in the text. There may occur
                            a "blank layer", with no text displayed, in which case you should just
                            move on one click. Such "blank layers" occur because the text moves from
                            one division down to a lower division which does not have any text and does not have a
                            header.</p>
                        <p>From the button in the left side of the screen, you have the option of
                            accessing the table of contents, allowing you to move from chapter to
                            chapter or section to section.</p>
                        <p>Clicking the title of the text will take you to the page displaying the
                            text's header and table of contents.</p>
